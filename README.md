# WindowsXPFormGuiTest
A project I made around or on the day I made Windows XP Gui Test on Roblox. Original project name is "WindowsFormsApp2". How original!
I don't even remember making this.

This "Windows Forms App" has THESE features:
- Launcher to choose between apps

- Web browser that DOESNT work unless it is updated to use a proper path

- Lotto Number Generator that I attempted to port from C++ from some random book I had at the time
